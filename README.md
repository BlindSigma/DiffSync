## DiffSync
This is an implementation of Differential Synchronisation as described here: https://neil.fraser.name/writing/sync/eng047-fraser.pdf

This repo isn't meant to be a full, stand-alone library for implementing the algorithm in your projects.
Rather, it's intended to be used as a reference for implementing the algorithm yourself.
